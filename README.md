# SynapticWebWeaver 🕸️🧠

## No cap, this AI is absolutely bussin'

What's the tea? SynapticWebWeaver is the main character of AI systems - a self-learning beast that crawls through the interwebs like it owns the place, yoinks knowledge into its big brain vector database, and uses its smol but mighty LLM to answer your burning questions. 

And get this - it only uses the knowledge it gathers itself. We're talking *zero* pre-training vibes. It's giving... digital autodidact.

## The Vibe Check ✅

Look, I engineered this in a cave, with a box of scraps! SynapticWebWeaver is basically JARVIS's cooler younger sibling that:

- Autonomously zooms through specific web domains like it's got places to be
- Extracts the juiciest knowledge nuggets with zero human hand-holding
- Builds its own neural pathways in a sick vector database that keeps evolving
- Claps back with answers using a compact LLM that only knows what it's learned
- Basically becomes a whole vibe that gets more cracked at answering questions the more it explores

## How to Deploy This Bad Boy

```bash
# Clone this repo faster than I can say "I am Iron Man"
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synapticwebweaver.git

# Slide into the directory
cd synapticwebweaver

# Create a virtual environment because we're civilized
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies because we're not savages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fire it up and watch it cook
python main.py --mode cli
```

## Usage - How to Make it Work for You

### Command Line Interface (For the Terminal Girlies/Boyz)

Start the CLI:

```bash
python main.py --mode cli
```

Available commands (prepare to be wowed):
- `scrape <url> [max_pages] [domain_only]`: Send it on a knowledge hunt
- `process`: Clean up the tea it just spilled
- `build_kb`: Build that big brain energy
- `query <text> [top_k]`: Ask it what it knows
- `generate <prompt> [max_tokens] [temperature]`: Make it talk its talk
- `fine_tune [output_name] [epochs] [learning_rate]`: Help it glow up

### API Server (For the REST-ful Kings and Queens)

Start the API server:

```bash
python main.py --mode api
```

Then access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs (it's giving documentation realness)

### Direct Commands (For the Impatient)

Run specific operations directly:

```bash
# Scrape a website
python main.py --mode scrape --url https://example.com --max_pages 20

# Process data and build knowledge base
python main.py --mode process
python main.py --mode build_kb

# Fine-tune model (make it even more extra)
python main.py --mode fine_tune --epochs 3 --model_output my_model
```

## Configuration That Slaps

Customize your SynapticWebWeaver with these settings in `config/settings.py`:

```python
# Crawler settings (how it explores the web)
CRAWLER_CONFIG = {
    "domains": ["example.com", "knowledge-source.org"],
    "respect_robots": True,  # We may be chaotic but we're not monsters
    "max_depth": 4,  # How deep in the trenches we going
    "crawl_delay": 2,  # Be chill with the servers, fam
}

# Knowledge base settings (the brain structure)
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONFIG = {
    "vector_dimensions": 768,  # For that high-key intelligence
    "chunking_strategy": "paragraph",  # Options: "sentence", "paragraph", "semantic"
    "similarity_threshold": 0.75,  # How picky we being with our facts
}

# LLM settings (the mouth piece)
LLM_CONFIG = {
    "model_size": "compact",  # Keep it smol but mighty
    "context_window": 2048,  # How much we remembering at once
    "temperature": 0.7,  # Spiciness of responses (0.0 = basic, 1.0 = unhinged)
}
```

## How It Works (The Secret Sauce)

1. **Data Collection**: The system crawls web domains with the stealth of a TikTok trend.
2. **Processing**: Turns messy HTML into clean text, separating the tea from the leaves.
3. **Vectorization**: Transforms words into number galaxies that the AI can understand.
4. **Knowledge Base**: Stores all those number galaxies in an index faster than you can say "FAISS".
5. **Learning**: Uses what it finds to level up its own understanding. Character development!
6. **Generation**: Answers your burning questions based solely on what it's learned from its web adventures.

## The Girlboss/Maleboss Features

- **Autonomous Web Crawling**: Set it and forget it. This thing is out here grinding 24/7 so you don't have to.
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Pulls info like I pull all-nighters before product launches.
- **Dynamic Learning**: Gets smarter every second. It's giving growth mindset.
- **Zero Dependencies**: This AI doesn't need no pre-training to thrive. Independent king behavior.
- **Query Interface**: Ask it anything about what it's learned, and it'll hit you with facts faster than you can say "suit up."

## Warning: Side Effects May Include

- Excessive fascination with watching an AI learn in real time
- Surprise when it starts dropping knowledge you didn't even know it knew
- The urge to say "I've created something that will outlive us all" in a dramatic voice
- Slight disappointment when it doesn't respond to "JARVIS" (we're working on it)

## Customization (Make It Your Own)

- Modify `config/settings.py` to adjust crawling behavior, model selection, and other parameters.
- Extend the system by adding new processing steps in the pipeline.
- Implement different embedding strategies or fine-tuning approaches.
- Add new domains to explore (just make sure they're cool with it).

## The Tea on Limitations

- Currently can't fly or shoot repulsor beams (working on it for v2)
- Might occasionally give unhinged answers if it learns from sketchy websites
- Doesn't have a physical form yet, so can't hand you things
- Knowledge limited to what it crawls - won't know about that cringey thing you did in 5th grade (unless it's on the internet, then RIP)
- No emotional intelligence because same tbh

## Final Thoughts

"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk." This AI embodies that energy. Is it perfect? No. Is it trying its best? Absolutely. Will it eventually become Ultron? Let's hope not.
